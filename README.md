**wireport** is a self-hosted ingress proxy and VPN tunnel that securely exposes private local and Docker-based services to the Internet, with free, automatically renewable SSL certificates. Powered by WireGuard (secure networking), CoreDNS and Caddy (performant reverse proxy).

- Exposing local and Docker-based services running in a local network (e.g., on the local machine, on a corporate network, on a NAS, or on a home server) to the Internet
- Secure tunneling into remote development/staging/production environments to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting of remote Docker-based services

## Features

- SSL/TLS termination with **100% free and automated certificate provisioning and renewal**
- **Reverse proxy** with support for HTTP(S) and TCP/UDP (Layer-4) (Caddy)
- **Secure VPN tunneling** (WireGuard)
- Automatic **service discovery and hostname resolution by Docker container names** (CoreDNS)
- **Multiplatform CLI** (Linux, macOS, Windows ‚Äî ARM64 & AMD64) for [**quick and easy setup**](#quick-start)
- **Self-hosted** and **open-source**
- **High performance** with a **low memory footprint**
- **No need to manually edit countless configuration files**: [quick and easy start](#quick-start) from the command line in just **two commands**

## Key Concepts

- **GATEWAY** ‚Äì a Linux-based machine with Docker installed, a public IP address, and the following open ports: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 4060/tcp and 51820/udp. This node acts as the ingress gateway and an entry point to your published services.
- **CLIENT** ‚Äì any number of laptops/PCs that will connect to the WireGuard network to manage the ingress network and expose services.
- **SERVER** *(optional)* ‚Äì one or more Linux-based machines (with Docker) that run the workloads you want to expose. These nodes join the same private WireGuard network, provided by the GATEWAY.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Running Unsigned Binaries on macOS and Windows

Since the binaries are **not signed with commercial certificates**, your operating system may prevent them from launching by default.  
You will need to manually allow them.

---

### ü™ü On Windows

When you try to launch the program, you may see a warning similar to:

> **Windows protected your PC**  
> Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

To proceed:

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

This will start the application despite the warning.

---

### üçé On macOS

When you attempt to open the app or installer, you may see:

> "**wireport** cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."

To allow it:

1. Open **Finder** and locate the application or `.pkg` file.
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the file and select **Open**.
3. You will see a similar warning, but this time it includes an **Open** button.
4. Click **Open** to confirm you trust the file.

Alternatively, you can allow the app through **System Preferences**:

1. Open **Apple Menu > System Settings > Privacy & Security > General**.
2. You will see a message that the app was blocked.
3. Click **Allow Anyway**.
4. Then, try opening the app again.

---

**Note:**
- These steps are necessary **only once per file**.
- If you have any concerns about file integrity, consider [verifying checksums](https://github.com/MultionLabs/wireport/releases) or building binaries from the source code yourself.
- In enterprise environments, administrators can whitelist the binaries using Group Policy (Windows) or Gatekeeper settings (macOS).

## Quick Start

You're **two commands** away from exposing your first service **from your local machine to the Internet**!

#### 1. Bootstrap a GATEWAY node

Run in your local terminal:

```bash
wireport gateway up sshuser@140.120.110.10:22
```

*(replace SSH username, IP, and PORT with the real details of the GATEWAY machine)*

<details>
<summary>Sample output</summary>

```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced usage scenarios</summary>

Use SSH key with an empty passphrase and dump the WireGuard config straight to the file:

```bash
wireport gateway up sshuser@140.120.110.10:22 --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa --ssh-key-pass-empty > ~/path/to/wireguard-config.conf
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Important ‚Äì firewall and other prerequisites</strong></summary>

`wireport gateway up` expects that:

1) the following ports must be reachable on the target GATEWAY machine *before* you run the command:

* 22/tcp (SSH)
* 80/tcp and 443/tcp (HTTP/HTTPS)
* 4060/tcp (Wireport control channel)
* 51820/udp (WireGuard)

Example with UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22,80,443,4060/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw enable
```

2) Docker is installed on the target GATEWAY machine
3) The account used for SSHing into the target GATEWAY machine has all the necessary permissions for managing Docker containers, images, and networks
</details>

<details>
<summary>wireport <strong>DOES NOT</strong> store SSH credentials</summary>

wireport relies on [goph](https://github.com/melbahja/goph) for handling SSH connections and executing commands on the target remote machines. The credentials are **never stored** by wireport and they only stay in the memory of your client device for the time of executing the commands (typically, a few seconds).
</details>

#### 2. Expose a local service to the Internet

Run in your local terminal:

```bash
wireport service publish \
  --local  http://10.0.0.2:3000 \
  --public https://demo.example.com:443
```

üéâ Congratulations! Your local service running on port 3000 is now securely accessible on the Internet at `https://demo.example.com/`. wireport automatically generates and renews SSL certificates for your domain.

<details>
<summary>Command and flags explained</summary>

This command supports different protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP) and automatically provisions a free SSL certificate for the domain when an HTTPS-based URL with a domain name is specified in the **--public** parameter, provided that a correct A-record is set up in your domain provider's DNS settings and points to the GATEWAY machine.

* **--local** ‚Äì URL of the service **on the machine where you run the command** (or another CLIENT/SERVER node from the wireport-managed WireGuard network)
* **--public** ‚Äì External protocol / hostname / port that will be reachable on the GATEWAY

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Important - DNS config and other prerequisites</strong></summary>

1) For the service to become available over the given public URL, there must be a respective `A`-record in the DNS settings of your domain name provider, pointing to the target **GATEWAY** machine's IP address.

2) After bootstrapping the GATEWAY node with the `wireport gateway up ...` command, you should add the respective WireGuard tunnel on your local machine

3) There must be a service running and accessible at the address specified in the `--local` flag provided to the `wireport service publish` command (this can be on any CLIENT or SERVER node in the wireport-managed WireGuard network)

4) The following ports are available for exposure on the GATEWAY machine (public URL of the exposed service): 80, 443

</details>

## Other useful commands

| Purpose | Command |
|:--------|:--------|
| Remove a public endpoint | `wireport service unpublish -p https://demo.example.com:443` |
| Adjust headers/timeouts | `wireport service params new -p https://demo.example.com:443 --param-value 'header_up X-Tenant-Hostname {http.request.host}'` |
| Create more CLIENTs | `wireport client new` |
| Add a workload SERVER | `wireport server up sshuser@140.120.110.10` |
| Tear down a SERVER | `wireport server down sshuser@140.120.110.10` |
| Tear down a GATEWAY | `wireport gateway down sshuser@140.120.110.10` |

Refer to `wireport --help` for the full CLI reference.

## Security Considerations

- The gateway container runs with privileged access for network configuration
- All traffic is encrypted using WireGuard
- Control traffic is encrypted (TLS)
- HTTPS is configurable for secure web access to exposed services

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check service logs: `docker logs wireport-gateway` or `docker logs wireport-server`
2. Verify firewall status & make sure all required ports are open
3. Check status of the WireGuard network inside the GATEWAY and SERVER wireport containers using `wg show` and other WireGuard commands
4. Check pingability of private services from inside GATEWAY, SERVER and CLIENT nodes
5. If a private service is not reachable, make sure the container is running and check its logs; check whether the target container (in case of the SERVER workloads) is attached to the `wireport-net` Docker network (wireport agent manages this automatically).
